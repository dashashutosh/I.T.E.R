  1>> The stdio libraryâ€™s file version of gets, fgets, behaves somewhat differently

  2>> .

  3>> Function fgets takes three argumentsâ€”the output parameter string, a maximum n

  4>> umber of characters to store (n), and the file pointer to the data source.

  5>> Function fgets will never store more than n âˆ’ 1 characters from the data file

  6>> ,

  7>> and the final character stored will always be '\0'. However, the next to last c

  8>> haracter may or may not be '\n'. If fgets has room to store the entire line of 

  9>> data,

 10>> it will include '\n' before '\0'. If the line is truncated, no '\n' is stored. 

 11>> Like

 12>> other string-building functions we have studied, fgets stores the string create

 13>> d

 14>> in its first argument and returns this string argument (i.e., its address) as i

 15>> ts value.

 16>> When a call to fgets encounters the end of file, the value returned is the addr

 17>> ess

 18>> 0, which is considered the null pointer. Figure 8.8 shows a program that scans 

 19>> a

 20>> data file one line at a time and creates a new double-spaced version with the l

 21>> ines

 22>> numbered.
